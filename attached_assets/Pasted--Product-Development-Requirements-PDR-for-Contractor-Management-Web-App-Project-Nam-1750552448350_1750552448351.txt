## User Experience Flow

1. User signs up → free trial begins (Core Plan features only)
2. User prompted to pay \$199 setup + pick plan (Core or Pro)
3. User optionally adds Concierge Onboarding (\$200)

## Notes for Development:

* Prioritize responsive layout for mobile use
* Create reusable feature flag system (e.g. "isPro", "setupPaid")
* Stripe integration should support both one-time charges and subscriptions
* Store Stripe subscription ID in user metadata for validation
* Build UI/UX to reflect pricing model: focus on simplicity and perceived value
* Consider adding CRM-style tags or timeline views in future updates

## Future Enhancements:

* Dedicated mobile app (PWA or native)
* File storage for blueprints and invoices
* Task chat/comments per job
* Multi-language support for Spanish-speaking contractors
